# Webdrivers

**DISCLAIMER:** one should *NEVER* commit anything inside this folder (except the `README.md`, of course :smile:), otherwise the remote git repository will soon be cluttered with a bunch of *webdriver* binaries.

*`morpheus/.gitignore`* is currently set to **not track** anything inside this folder but README.md.

Webdrivers can be placed inside this folder for organization purposes (it is not mandatory).

However, it is necessary to provide webdriver path in file *`morpheus/environment.py`* through the variable **WEBDRIVER_PATH**.
