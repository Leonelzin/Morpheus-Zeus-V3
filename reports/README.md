# Robot Framework Test Reports

**DISCLAIMER:** one should *NEVER* commit anything inside this folder (except the `README.md`, of course), otherwise the remote git repository will soon be cluttered with a bunch of reports and screenshots auto-generated by *Robot Framework*.

*`morpheus/.gitignore`* is currently set to **not track** anything inside this folder but README.md.

At the end of a test execution all Robot Framework reports will be placed inside this folder by default.

The test initialization script [morpheus/run_tests.py](../run_tests.py) creates a specific test report folder for every test execution. A test report folder follows this pattern:

```
morpheus/reports/DUTModelName_DUTFirmwareVersion_UNIXTimestamp/
```

It is possible to change where *Robot Framework* reports will be placed using the parameter **`-o`** to the run_tests.py script.

```
python run_tests.py -d devices/AP1350AC.py -o desired/reports/path/here
```
